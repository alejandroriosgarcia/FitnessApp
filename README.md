GENERAL HEALTH AND FITNESS APP (STRUCTURED FOR MY USE CASES)

**I don't have mock data, so app works best when ran on physical device**

Must have features:
- Tracking steps (Automatically)
- Tracking calories burned (Automatically)
- Charting data above

Nice to have features:
- Track workouts outside of steps and calories burned
- Fill progress meter throughout given day/time period

Used youtube video to learn HealthKit implementation
Used progress bar from youtube video
